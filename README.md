# A Simple Shell Script to send Eamils Via Amazon SES.


###### In this script I'm using AWS SES to send emails. I'm using this script/code to send all type of my 
Server Alarms/Notifications.

###### I found this way is more simple and reliable than the other ways like using default Server SMTP OR Others.
